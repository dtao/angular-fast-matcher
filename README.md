# angular-fast-matcher

This library provides an Angular directive that can be used to make super-fast, prefix-based
**autocomplete** elements.

To install it, add angularFastMatcher.js to your app and require the `'fastMatcher'` module:

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp', ['fastMatcher']);
```

For an example as well as further information on how to use the directive, check out
