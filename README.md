# angular-fast-matcher

This library provides an Angular directive that can be used to make super-fast, prefix-based **autocomplete** elements. It's implemented using the [fast-matcher](https://github.com/dtao/fast-matcher) library.

To install it, add angularFastMatcher.js to your app and require the `'fastMatcher'` module:

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp', ['fastMatcher']);
```

For an example as well as further information on how to use the directive, check out [the demo](http://danieltao.com/angular-fast-matcher), which lets you search 50,000+ books by title from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
